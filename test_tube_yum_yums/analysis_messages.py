high_RBC_count = "Higher RBC Count can be due to several reasons including dehydration, smoking, being on high altitude, due to medications such as Gentamycin/Mrthyldopa or due to underlying causes such as Pulmonary Fibrosis or Renal Cell Carcinoma in severe cases."
low_RBC_count = "Lower RBC Count can be due to several reasons including overhydration, malnutrition, pregnancy, due to medications such as chemotherapy, chloraphenicol, hydantois, quinidine or due to underlying causes such as Hemolysis, Anaemia or internal bleeding."
RDW_high_MCV_high_MCHC_high = "The simultaneous increase in RDW, MCV and MCHC suggest either Vitamin(B9 & B12) deficiency or Megaloblastic anaemia."
RDW_high_MCV_high_MCHC_low = "The simultaneous increase in RDW and MCV followed by low MCHC levels suggest Vitamin(B9 & B12) deficiency causing anaemia."
RDW_high_MCV_low_MCHC_high = "The simultaneous increase in RDW and MCHC followed by low MCV levels suggest Thalassamia. Please consult your doctor in this regard."
RDW_high_MCV_low_MCHC_low = "The increase in RDW followed by simultaneous low MCV and MCHC levels suggests Iron Deficiency anaemia."
RDW_low_MCV_high_MCHC_high = "The simultaneous increase in MCHC and MCV can be due to Liver Disease, Aplastic Anaemia or an underlying AutoImmune disease. Either your bone marrow is not producing enough RBCs or your RBCs are being destroyed due to underlying issues."
RDW_low_MCV_high_MCHC_low = "The increase in MCV followed by low MCHC levels suggests Aplastic anaemia."
RDW_low_MCV_low_MCHC_high = "The increase in MCHC followed by low MCV levels suggests Thalassamia. It's recommended to avoid dairy products, ciggarate and alcohol consumption. If you do not have thalassamia, the food suggestions below might be irrelevant."
RDW_low_MCV_low_MCHC_low = "The simultaneous low MCHC and MCV levels suggests Chronic anaemia or Thalassamia. If you've thalassamia, keep your iron intake in mind while following the food suggestions."
RDW_low_MCV_normal_MCHC_high_platelets_low = "High MCHC followed by low platelets points towards internal bleeding. Please consult your doctor immediately."
RDW_low_MCV_normal_MCHC_high_platelets_normal = "High MCHC level suggests recent blood loss. Immediately consulting your doctor is recommended."
RDW_low_MCV_normal_MCHC_low = "Low MCHC levels point towards Chronic Kidney Disease. Immediately consult your doctor if you've history of CKD."
TLC_high = "Common reasons for low TLC are stress, inflamation, blood or tissue disorder or in some cases rheumatoid artheritis."
TLC_low = "Common reasons for high TLC are infections such as influenza, tuberculosis, typhoid, dengue, malaria, etc. Chemotherapy can also increase TLC."
DLC_E_high = "The increase in your eosinophils suggests that your body is fighting some parasite, bacteria or has some allergy."
DLC_L_high = "The increase in your lymphocytes suggests that your body is fighting a chronic infection again."
DLC_B_high = "The increase in your basophils suggests that your body is producing extra histamines which could be due to an allergy."
DLC_N_or_M_high = "The increase in monocytes or neutrophils suggests that your body has recently fought an infection."
platelets_high_MPV_high = "High platelets accompanied with high MPV may be because your bone marrow produces too many platelets due to genetic mutation or cancer."
platelets_high_MPV_low = "High platelets but low MPV could be due to an infection, an inflammation or cancer."
platelets_high_MPV_normal = "High platelets could be due to spleen removal or pre-existing conditions."
platelets_low_MPV_high = "Low platelets with high MPV could be because your platelets are being destroyed either by antibodies, infections or toxins."
platelets_low_MPV_low = "Low platelets and MPV could be because of bone Marrow disorders like aplastic anaemia slowing the production of platelets."
platelets_low_MPV_normal = "Low platelets could be due to pregnancy, viral infections, autoimmune diseases or due to certain medications like chemotherapy."
platelets_normal_MPV_high = "High MPV levels could be due to several medical conditions including Hyperthyroidism or Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia."
platelets_normal_MPV_low = "Low MPV levels could be due to several medical conditions including Chronic Kidney Failure."
Hb_high = "Many conditions that lead to high hemoglobin are chronic. However, dehydration, high altitude or frequent smoking and alcohol consumption could also pump the haemoglobin levels."
Hb_low = "Low haemoglobin levels could be due to several reasons including less RBC production, faster death of RBCs, blood loss, or lack of body's ability to absorb nutrients for developing RBCs."
